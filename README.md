# KMR_dxluc

Library for an easy use of Dynamixel motors with the OpenCM9.04 board. \n
It completes and expands the Dynamixel2Arduino library, implementing syncWrite and bulkRead for faster communication with the motors. \n
The hardware abstraction allows an easy use of this library.

It works with both protocols 1 and 2, and is written in C++.

The documentation explaining how to use the library can be found [here](docs/markdown_sources/mainpage.md).
